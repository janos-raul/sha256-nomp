# SHA256-NOMP - Node Open Mining Portal
[![GitHub CI](https://github.com/janos-raul/sha256-nomp/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/janos-raul/sha256-nomp/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

This is a SHA256 mining pool with solo mining support and ASICBoost with version rolling, based on Node Open Mining Portal.
  
#### Production Usage Notice
This is beta software. All of the following are things that can change and break an existing SHA256-NOMP setup: functionality of any feature, structure of configuration files and structure of redis data. If you use this software in production then *DO NOT* pull new code straight into production usage because it can and often will break your setup and require you to tweak things like config files or redis data. *Only tagged releases are considered stable.*

#### Paid Solution
Usage of this software requires abilities with sysadmin, database admin, coin daemons, and sometimes a bit of programming. Running a production pool can literally be more work than a full-time job.

### Features

* ✅ **Solo Mining Support** - Miners can mine solo with `m=solo` password parameter
* ✅ **ASICBoost Support** - Full support with version rolling for mining optimization
* ✅ **Fixed Payment System** - Resolved double fee deduction issue (v1.4.1)
* ✅ **Multiple Payment Modes** - PROP and PPLNT payment systems
* ✅ **Dual Mining** - Support pool and solo mining simultaneously

### Recent Updates (v1.4.1)

* **FIXED**: Double fee deduction bug in solo mining payment processing
* **IMPROVED**: Solo mining fees now correctly compensate for coinbase rewardRecipients
* **ENHANCED**: Consistent fee handling for both 'generate' and 'immature' blocks
* **OPTIMIZED**: Payment processor efficiency improvements

### Community

If your pool uses SHA256-NOMP let us know and we will list your website here.

Usage
=====

#### Requirements
* Coin daemon(s) (find the coin's repo and build latest version from source)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v16+ ([follow these installation instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager))
* [Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store v2.6+ ([follow these instructions](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart))

##### Seriously
Those are legitimate requirements. If you use old versions of Node.js or Redis that may come with your system package manager then you will have problems. Follow the linked instructions to get the last stable versions.

[**Redis security warning**](http://redis.io/topics/security): be sure firewall access to redis - an easy way is to
include `bind 127.0.0.1` in your `redis.conf` file. Also it's a good idea to learn about and understand software that
you are using - a good place to start with redis is [data persistence](http://redis.io/topics/persistence).

#### 0) Setting up coin daemon
Follow the build/install instructions for your coin daemon. Your coin.conf file should end up looking something like this:
```
daemon=1
rpcuser=username
rpcpassword=password
rpcport=8332
```
For redundancy, its recommended to have at least two daemon instances running in case one drops out-of-sync or offline,
all instances will be polled for block/transaction updates and be used for submitting blocks. Creating a backup daemon
involves spawning a daemon using the `-datadir=/backup` command-line argument which creates a new daemon instance with
it's own config directory and coin.conf file. Learn about the daemon, how to use it and how it works if you want to be
a good pool operator. For starters be sure to read:

#### 1) Downloading & Installing

Clone the repository and run `npm install` for all the dependencies to be installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsodium-dev libboost-all-dev libgmp3-dev node-gyp libssl-dev -y
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
sudo npm install n -g
sudo n stable
sudo apt purge nodejs npm -y
git clone https://github.com/janos-raul/sha256-nomp
cd sha256-nomp
npm install
```

#### 2) Configuration

##### Portal config
Inside the `config_example.json` file, ensure the default configuration will work for your environment, then copy the file to `config.json`.

##### Coin config
Inside the `coins` directory, ensure a json file exists for your coin. If it does not you will have to create it.
Here is an example of the required fields:
````javascript
{
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "symbol": "BTC",
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    "asicboost": true,  // Enable ASICBoost with version rolling

    // Coinbase value is what is added to a block when it is mined
    "coinbase": "SHA256NOMP",
    
    /* Magic value only required for setting up p2p block notifications. */
    "peerMagic": "f9beb4d9", //optional
    "peerMagicTestnet": "0b110907" //optional

    //"txMessages": false, //optional - defaults to false
}
````

##### Pool config
Take a look at the example json file inside the `pool_configs` directory. Rename it to `bitcoin.json` and change the
example fields to fit your setup.

```
Please Note that: 1 Difficulty is actually 8192, 0.125 Difficulty is actually 1024.

Whenever a miner submits a share, the pool counts the difficulty and keeps adding them as the shares.

ie: Miner 1 mines at 0.1 difficulty and finds 10 shares, the pool sees it as 1 share. Miner 2 mines at 0.5 difficulty and finds 5 shares, the pool sees it as 2.5 shares.
```

        "disableTransactions": true
    }
}
```

#### Solo Mining Configuration

Miners connect for solo mining using the password parameter:
```
Username: YOUR_BITCOIN_ADDRESS
Password: m=solo
```

Example connections:
* **CGMiner**: `cgminer -o stratum+tcp://yourpool.com:3032 -u YOUR_ADDRESS -p m=solo`
* **With custom difficulty**: `cgminer -o stratum+tcp://yourpool.com:3032 -u YOUR_ADDRESS -p m=solo,d=65536`

##### [Optional, recommended] Setting up blocknotify
1. In `config.json` set the port and password for `blockNotifyListener`
2. In your daemon conf file set the `blocknotify` command to use:
```
node [path to cli.js] [coin name in config] [block hash symbol]
```
Example: inside `bitcoin.conf` add the line
```
blocknotify=node /home/user/sha256-nomp/scripts/cli.js blocknotify bitcoin %s
```

Alternatively, you can use a more efficient block notify script written in pure C. Build and usage instructions
are commented in [scripts/blocknotify.c](scripts/blocknotify.c).

#### 3) Start the portal

```bash
npm start
```

###### Optional enhancements for your awesome new mining pool server setup:
* Use something like [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) to keep the node script running
in case the master process crashes.
* Use something like [redis-commander](https://github.com/joeferner/redis-commander) to have a nice GUI
for exploring your redis database.
* Use something like [logrotator](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/07/logrotate-examples/) to rotate log
output from SHA256-NOMP.
* Use [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) to monitor your SHA256-NOMP instance and server performance.

#### Upgrading SHA256-NOMP
When updating SHA256-NOMP to the latest code its important to not only `git pull` the latest from this repo, but to also update
the `node-stratum-pool` and `node-multi-hashing` modules, and any config files that may have been changed.
* Inside your SHA256-NOMP directory (where the init.js script is) do `git pull` to get the latest SHA256-NOMP code.
* Remove the dependencies by deleting the `node_modules` directory with `rm -r node_modules`.
* Run `npm update` to force updating/reinstalling of the dependencies.
* Compare your `config.json` and `pool_configs/coin.json` configurations to the latest example ones in this repo or the ones in the setup instructions where each config field is explained. <b>You may need to modify or add any new changes.</b>
